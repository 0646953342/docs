# Exporting

Generally you will use the *File > Save* to save your work with full
information as a `.ase` or `.aseprite` file
([both are the same](/faq/#is-there-any-difference-between-ase-and-aseprite-files)). Then
you can export your sprite for your own game, website, application,
etc. using the *File > Export* menu option to convert your sprite into
a `.gif` file or a sequence of `.png` files.

*File > Export* will remember the latest options you've used in case
that you want to save the copy again.

## Export as a sequence of images

You can save the whole animation as a sequence specifying a file name
with a number and a file type for static images. E.g. `frame1.png`
where `1` specifies the number of the first frame, and `.png` the
static file type used to save each frame. See how to
[load a sequence of images](open.md#loading-image-sequences).

If you specify other file name like `frame001.png` file names will be
like `frame001.png`, `frame002.png`, `frame003.png`, etc.

## Export just one frame

Since **Aseprite v1.2-beta2** you can save one frame (or the set of selected frames/layers):

## Automatic Resize on Export

This dialog contains a special *Resize* field so you can save your
copy with other scale. E.g. It's useful to upload your animation to
Twitter, that needs higher scales (e.g. 400% of your original sprite
size).
