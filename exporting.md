# Exporting

Generally you will use the *File > Save* to save your work with full
information as a `.ase` or `.aseprite` file (both are the same, just
the extension is different). Then you can export your sprite to be
used in other programs (a website, videogame, etc.) using *File > Save
Copy As* to export your sprite to `.gif` files or a sequence of `.png`
files. See the [Save menu](save.md) section for more information.

You can see the *File > Save Copy As* as an export/or publish option,
which will remember the latest options you've used in case that you
want to save the copy again.
