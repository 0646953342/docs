# Debug

In case that you are having some problem running Aseprite, you can
execute it with the `--debug` option in the command line.

After running Aseprite, you will see that a
`Aseprite-v1.1.9-DebugOutput.txt` file (or with a similar name) will
be created in your desktop.  You can send us that file at
[support@aseprite.org](mailto:support@aseprite.org) so we can help us
solving your specific problem.

On Steam the `--debug` parameter is added in the launch options:
