# Troubleshooting

If you have a problem starting Aseprite (e.g. it starts and closes
inmediately), you can try the [debug option](debug.md).

You might try to find your problem on:

* [Steam General Discussion forum](http://steamcommunity.com/app/431730/discussions/0/)
* [Steam Bug Reports forum](http://steamcommunity.com/app/431730/discussions/2/)
* [Closed bugs on the GitHub](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20%20label%3Abug)

As usual, you can always contact us at
[mailto:support@aseprite.org](support@aseprite.org) for any kind of
problem or issue.
