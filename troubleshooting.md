# Troubleshooting

If you have a problem starting Aseprite (e.g. it starts and closes
inmediately), you can try the [debug option](debug.md).

If you are having other issues you might try your problem in the known
issues on Steam Forums
([General Discussion](http://steamcommunity.com/app/431730/discussions/0/)/[Bug Reports](http://steamcommunity.com/app/431730/discussions/2/))
or
[closed bugs on the GitHub](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20%20label%3Abug).

As usual, you can always contact us at
[mailto:support@aseprite.org](support@aseprite.org) for any kind of
problem or issue.
