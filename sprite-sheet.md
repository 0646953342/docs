# Sprite sheets

A sprite sheet is one big image with several frames of the same sprite
on it. For example, you can save this animation:

![Running Guy](sprite-sheet/running-guy.gif)

Like an horizontal sprite sheet:

![Horizontal Sprite Sheet](sprite-sheet/running-guy-horz.png)

A vertical one:

![Vertical Sprite Sheet](sprite-sheet/running-guy-vert.png)
