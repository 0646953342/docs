# Copy Cels

Use the [timeline](timeline.md) to copy cels:

![Copy cels](copy-cels/copy-cels.gif)

1. Select a range of cels you want to copy.
2. Move the mouse to the selection border.
3. Hold `Ctrl` or `Alt` key and start dragging.
4. Drop the copy where you want, holding `Ctrl` or `Alt` keys.

Note that you can copy cels beyond the end of the animation. In this
case new empty frames are created automatically.
