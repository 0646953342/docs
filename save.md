# Save

You can save your sprite using *File > Save* menu.

Aseprite uses `.aseprite` (or `.ase`) file types to save full sprite
information (layers, frames, tags, palettes, etc.). But you can save

## Save as a copy

If you want to export your sprite as a `.png` file or a `.gif`
animation, you can use the *File > Save Copy As* option.

Tip: This dialog contains a special *Resize* field so you can save
your copy with other scale. E.g. It's useful to upload your animation
to Twitter, that needs higher scales (e.g. 400% of your original
sprite size).

## Saving image sequences

You can save the whole animation as a sequence using *File > Save As*
or *File > Save Copy As* and specifying a file name with a number and
a file type for static images. E.g. `frame1.png` where `1` specifies
the number of the first frame, and `.png` the static file type used to
save each frame. See how to [load a sequence of images](open.md#loading-image-sequences).
