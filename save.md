# Save

You can save your sprite using *File > Save* menu.

Aseprite uses `.aseprite` (or `.ase`) file types to save full sprite
information (layers, frames, tags, palettes, etc.). But you can save
your sprite as other file types if you don't need all this information.
For example, you can [open](open.md) a `.png` file, editing it,
and save it again as `.png` (without using the `.aseprite` format).

## Save as a copy

If you want to export your sprite as a `.png` file or a `.gif`
animation, you can use the *File > Save Copy As* option.

Tip: This dialog contains a special *Resize* field so you can save
your copy with other scale. E.g. It's useful to upload your animation
to Twitter, that needs higher scales (e.g. 400% of your original
sprite size).

## Saving image sequences

You can save the whole animation as a sequence using *File > Save As*
or *File > Save Copy As* and specifying a file name with a number and
a file type for static images. E.g. `frame1.png` where `1` specifies
the number of the first frame, and `.png` the static file type used to
save each frame. See how to [load a sequence of images](open.md#loading-image-sequences).

## Save just one frame

Since **Aseprite v1.2-beta2** you can save one frame (or the set of selected frames/layers):
