# Save

You can save your sprite using *File > Save* menu.

Aseprite uses `.aseprite` (or `.ase`) file types to save full sprite
information (layers, frames, tags, palettes, etc.). But you can save
your sprite as other file types if you don't need all this information.
For example, you can [open](open.md) a `.png` file, editing it,
and save it again as `.png` (without using the `.aseprite` format).

## Export

If you want to export your sprite as a `.png` file or a `.gif`
animation, you can use the *File > Export* option. See the
[Exporting](/docs/exporting/) section for more information.
